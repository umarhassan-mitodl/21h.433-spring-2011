### Debate Resolution

_"By the end of the seventeenth century, the English had developed an alternative to absolute monarchy, ended the authority of the Church in politics and society, and recognized the need for state-supported scientific research. In essence, by 1700 England had created the first modern, secular, science and technology-driven society_."

Debate teams may want to meet ahead of time to prepare the arguments they will use during the debate. Teams should also anticipate their opponent's arguments and questions from the floor, and prepare rebuttal points. Each team should designate ahead of time who will a) deliver the opening argument; b) deliver the rebuttal; c) respond to questions; and d) make the closing statement. Each speaker should stand when presenting an argument or rebuttal, and should speak slowly and clearly. If possible, practice your presentations before the day of the debate. Finally, at the start of the debate each participant is required to turn in a single-sided, one page position statement. Each team member will be graded individually.
